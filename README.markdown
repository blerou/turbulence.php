Hopefully-meaningful Metrics

(Based on https://github.com/chad/chuggle)

A quick hack based on Michael Feathers' recent work in project churn and complexity: http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&ObjectType=COL&ObjectId=16679&tth=DYN&tt=siteemail&iDyn=2

Usage:
chuggle /path/to/git/project/path/to /path/to/git/project

It uses PDepend to calculate complexity (http://pdepend.org/).
